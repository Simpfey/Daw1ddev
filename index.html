<p class="desc">I'm Daw1dDevv (formally Dawid), and our dev team is Daw1d Studios on Roblox that's all right?</p>

<p class="desc" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;">We make games, unique ones that are trying to be outstanding from every game on the Roblox platform. I do Animating, UI Design, Modeling, VFX, Graphic Design, and Drawing sometimes too. At this moment I'm trying to learn LUA programming language and still training VFX.</p>

<p class="desc"> Yeah, these games are on Roblox, but trust me, the quality of these games or the ideas that are unique are good... at least i think so. </p>

<p class="desc" style="padding-top: 15px;">I really recommend you to try out our latest and popular games.</p>

                <h6 class="desc"><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/18484965925/" class="title underline">Rover's RNG</a> is basically a RNG game, BUT, a unique one!  In short, you can roll (+more coming in the future), collect emotes, buy upgrades that will help you with the game, make new friends, build a friendship and trust with NPC's, collect achievements that give you random rewards, customize your gameplay as you want, check the latest or the oldest updates in the update log, create a guild and a small community to fight other clans, top leaderboards, check other player profiles, sleep, etc...

The game involves over 770 levels, counting all the modes that have been added to the game so far... You can also do quests, collecting emotes, play minigames that count solo and 1v1 modes, do speedruns by selecting a category, build a friendship with your NPC friends, and collect various achievements that can give you granted rewards like nametags, emotes, etc. And more! <br /> (Recommended playing on a public server)</h6>
